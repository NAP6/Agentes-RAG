9,NarrativeText,"Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when ﬁne-tuned on down- stream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl- edge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem- ory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com- pare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge- intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures.

11,NarrativeText,"Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl- edge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down- sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,",application/pdf,['eng'],1,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf,"This block discusses the advantages and disadvantages of pre-trained neural language models, highlighting their limitations in memory expansion, revision, and prediction transparency.

* The encoded query 'q' is processed to 'q(x)' and then fed into ""MIPS"" (likely a retrieval model).
* MIPS interacts with a ""Document Index"" containing documents represented by wavy lines (d(z)). Documents are retrieved based on similarity with the query. 

**Right Side (Blue Box):**

We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores.

Concurrent work [14] learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].",application/pdf,['eng'],9,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf,"This paragraph discusses memory-based architectures in the context of document retrieval for neural networks, comparing and contrasting them with other approaches.","Patrick Lewis,Ethan Perez,Aleksandra Piktus,Fabio Petroni,Vladimir Karpukhin,Naman Goyal,Heinrich KÃ¼ttler,Mike Lewis,Wen-tau Yih,Tim RocktÃ¤schel,Sebastian Riedel,Douwe Kiela","Facebook AI Research,University College London,New York University",2020,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,5 Related Work

206,NarrativeText,"For open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training the model with each (q, a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query.",application/pdf,['eng'],18,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf,"This block discusses the use of multiple answer annotations in open-domain question answering (QA) systems, specifically focusing on extractive models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

207,NarrativeText,"CuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres- sions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20]. To overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.",application/pdf,['eng'],18,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf,"This text describes a preprocessing step used to adapt the CuratedTrec dataset for answer-generation models.

208,NarrativeText,"TriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop- ment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are consistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public TriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set instead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See appendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches. We ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more conventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from Wikipedia.",application/pdf,['eng'],18,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf,"This block discusses the evaluation setups for TriviaQA, including the use of different test datasets like the TriviaQA Web Development split and the official TriviaQA Wikipedia test set.

The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The ﬁrst is to classify the claim as either ""Supported"", ""Refuted"" or ""Not Enough Info"", which is the task we explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia as evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction.

212,NarrativeText,"We experimented with adding ""Null document"" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if k documents were retrieved, we would additionally ""retrieve"" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over k + 1 predictions. We explored modelling this null document logit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or (iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.",application/pdf,['eng'],18,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf,"This paragraph describes the authors' experiments with a ""Null document"" mechanism in RAG and their findings on the Open MS-MARCO dataset.","Patrick Lewis,Ethan Perez,Aleksandra Piktus,Fabio Petroni,Vladimir Karpukhin,Naman Goyal,Heinrich KÃ¼ttler,Mike Lewis,Wen-tau Yih,Tim RocktÃ¤schel,Sebastian Riedel,Douwe Kiela","Facebook AI Research,University College London,New York University",2020,Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,F Null Document Probabilities

In these cases, once retrieval had collapsed, the generator would learn to ignore the documents, and the RAG model would perform equivalently to BART. The collapse could be due to a less-explicit requirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result in less informative gradients for the retriever.
